Y car back everything was fine until I suddenly get this sudden jerking of my car after I had made a right hand turn and as I was trying to accelerate to the posted speed limit, I honestly believed that one of my tires was about to break off while driving on the freeway with my two daughters in the vehicle with me while traveling to my sister's house nearly 35 minutes away from my residence. When I felt it, it startled me to the point where I believed that I might have popped a tire. I pulled over to check and nothing visible was wrong. Being 5 minutes away from my sisters house I drove to her house with my hazard lights on and after every turn I would feel as if one of my tires was going to just fall right off. My brother in law is a mechanic and I asked him to take it for a careful drive in an empty parking lot so he can feel what I was trying to explain to him. So he did and he said that it might be either the transmission not shifting properly and could be slipping, or the second theory is that the rear toe link can be either broken or damaged. He didn't know that I had already taken it to the dealer to have it replaced. I told him that the dealer had already replaced the rear toe link and his facial expression was very clear to understand that he was not sure if they did actually fix it or possibly mess with something else,  because they might have believed I would have taken my car to get fixed there.

The issue at hand revolves around a defective water pump, which has manifested in various models, including but not limited to:  - Ford Edge - Ford Explorer - Ford Flex - Ford Fusion - Ford Taurus - Lincoln Continental - Lincoln MKT - Lincoln MKX  Owners of these vehicles are experiencing a significant and alarming risk of stalling in traffic, posing a severe threat to both driver and passenger safety. The potential consequences, including the increased likelihood of accidents and fatalities, demand immediate attention and action from Ford Motor Company who has been sued multiple times and is avoiding to respond to the judgements against them trying to use any excuse not to pay.  It is imperative to address this widespread concern promptly, as the safety and well-being of Ford and Lincoln vehicle owners are at stake. I urge your organization to conduct a thorough investigation into the defective water pump issue, implement a comprehensive recall, and provide a reliable solution to rectify the problem.  Your commitment to prioritizing the safety of consumers is paramount, and I trust that Ford Motor Company will take swift and decisive action to remedy this situation. By addressing this issue promptly, you not only ensure the protection of current owners but also uphold the reputation of Ford and Lincoln in the automotive industry. It's impossible to say that it is a mere coincidence that thousands of Ford vehicles have the same defect with exactly the same engine and symptoms.

If a microscopic crack is present, condensation can potentially enter the reversing lamp lens through these cracks and cause electrical failure to the reverse lamps. Safety Risk This may result in inoperative reverse lamps which can reduce the awareness of other motorists or road users of the drivers intention to operate the vehicle in reverse gear, increasing the risk of injury or crash. Remedy Ford Motor Company has authorized your dealer to replace the rear lightbar free of charge parts and labor.  Campaign/NHTSA# 23C38/23V801 Issue Date 2023-11-28 Description Affected vehicles may have software logic that does not reset the electronic stability control esc system to default operation at the initiation of each ignition cycle. Section 5.4.1 of fmvss no. 126 requires that the vehicles esc system return to the manufacturers original default esc mode at the initiation of each ignition cycle Safety Risk The vehicle operator may not notice that the vehicle operates differently after receiving the ota update 6.3.0 and now remains in off-road mode with a reduced esc state after cycling the ignition. If the vehicle operator does not notice the esc off telltale in the cluster, they may not know the vehicle is in a reduced esc state. For these vehicles, failing to revert back to a normal esc-on state after being in off-road mode makes the vehicles noncompliant to fmvss no. 126, increasing the risk of crash. Remedy The remedy for this program is a software update to accessory protocol interface module apim. Ford began Ford power-up over-the-air deployments to update the apim software for affected vehicles in November 2023. Alternatively, owners will have the option to take their vehicle to a Ford or Lincoln dealer to complete the software update.

In the recent weeks of 1/5/2024 - 2/9/2024 the Power steering assist has gone out while maneuvering in and out of our garage multiple times. With a restart, the power assist comes back and seems to be ok for a few days until recently while driving, multiple times the steering wheel became locked in the 12:00 position and it took extra effort to turn the wheel from center. It appears as a faulty or sized rack and pinion. Also recently noticed audible noise while turning the steering wheel from lock to lock coming from the steering rack.  I am an Automotive Technician in the field for 30+ years. That next morning I raised the vehicles front wheels off the ground and rotated the steering wheel with engine off to investigate the issue. I noticed a severe binding issue while rotating the steering wheel where the steering wheel will come to a binding stop and it takes 2 hands to get past the binding. At this point I knew this is a major safety concern and to not have my wife drive this vehicle anymore until repaired. I have researched the Technical Service bulletins on this issue and searched the internet as well. Obviously this has become a very common issue on these Explorers with all the filed complaints and the lack of availability of a replacement Rack and Pinion. I went to the Ford dealer to inquire about this known issue and safety concern and they said there are no recalls for this problem on this vehicle.  Fortunately I caught this issue before the rack and pinion did seize into a position where my wife would not have been able to steer out of it and crash into another person, car or object. I understand that components eventually wear and fail over the vehicles lifetime and need replacing, but this seems to be a bigger issue and safety concern which needs addressing.

We filled coolant back up, the check engine light went off, and all seemed good. Within 2 weeks the check engine light came on again and the coolant was completely out. No leaks noticed anywhere. I researched and found lots of articles/lawsuit against Ford for this very issue. It included potential fire issue from engine overheating and more. We returned the vehicle to the dealership (now Wareing Ford Sturgis) and they indicated it was probably a leak into the engine itself, which was a known problem by Ford and the dealerships. They mentioned some customers were buying extended warranty coverage before having the dealership diagnose the problem and that it could save us a lot of money.

During inspections and replacements under previous warranties, Ford refuses to address the transmission portion of the problem and will and would only correct the by-product which was the clutch itself.

Yes available for inspection upon request. Safety? I don't know what happens if I keep driving which I have to because the recommended fix is a replacement engine which is $8,050. I've read many other comments from other people who are also stuck paying for a vehicle they can't or shouldn't be driving. Yes confirmed by a dealership service department. No not inspected by manufacturer, police, or insurance representative. Yes check engine light came on months ago when first checked out by same dealer was told I needed a powertrain control module. Please make ford take responsibility for this. Everyday people can not afford this and leaves us basically screwed.

The parts aren't in so it is delaying the repair.  The main question I have is every time I have a recall I am told I have to wait for the part to break so they can send to Ford as proof in order to get the parts.  This does not make sense to me as this is a safety issue am I to wait to get injured because the recalled part finally breaks and then I can use the recall to repair my vehicle?,IVOQ,N,,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,V,,N,N,Illinois,Q1, ~ ,,,,,,,,,> 36K,2024-02-22
