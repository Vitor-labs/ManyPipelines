The vehicle engine has been inspected by a Ford dealership in Jacksonville Fl. The engine warning light has come on several times since late 2022 or early 2023. This is when it 1st appeared. 2 dates are significant here: 3/28/23 an engine diagnostic completed due to engine light on, a slight mist detected into cylinder one.  2/19/24 another engine diagnostic completed at Autonation Ford in Jacksonville FL. Confirmed to me by telephone conversation that coolant is leaking into a cylinder. The remedy: a new, remanufactured or used engine has to be installed. All this information is on the 2.0 L Ecoboost engine made by Ford Motor Co. This  problem has been known by Ford since maybe as early 2013, not only on this model from 2015-2018 but on the Ford Fusion 2017-2019, Ford Escape, built on or before 16 May-2019. Lincoln Model MKC, built on or before18-April 2019; 2017-2019 MKZ, built on or before 8-April 2019.
