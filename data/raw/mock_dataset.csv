I purchased the vehicle in August of 2016 brand new with 34 miles on it.  The motor has a manufacturing defect, the block was built in the same plant (Hermosillo, HERMOSILLO, MEXICO)that other Ecoboost motors were built in that were recalled for the coolant leaking into cylinders via a ""fix"" which was cutting a channel between the cylinders on the deck of the long block between the cylinder walls, this compromised the integrity of the seal between the cylinder head and head gasket. This allowed coolant to leak into cylinder 4 of my vehicle.   Ford has known about the issue for the last several years and continues to make these motors.   The dealer I purchased the vehicle from wants $14,000 to replace the motor with a new long block but I would not feel comfortable having that done and would want a crate engine as the other components would now be compromised.   I have spent $1200 on replacement coil packs and spark plugs, coolant and oil, all to treat the symptoms. In addition to Fords $260 diagnostic fee at the dealer for a known defect.   Ford should not get away with bilking customers for $10,000 plus engine rebuilds - this would likely not last the same miles it has gone currently in my case.

The solution Ford has for it is not to do anything about it in numerous vehicles having the same faulty parts is to sell you a corrected part and charge you around $4000/labor?  Really?

On 2-22-24 I refueled after work and car would not start.

White smoke began emitting from exhaust and they discovered spark plugs as well as engine cylinders were soaked with oil, also coolant was nearly gone despite no signs of a leak. Upon doing research they discovered this website and pending class action lawsuits against Ford for faulty engine design that knowingly causes coolant to leak into cylinders, thus causing engine block to fail. They advised me to trade/sell the car immediately but also to have Ford give their opinion. AAA towed the car to Sarasota Ford on 2-28-24 and they called on 3-1-24 to report the engine had completely failed and it would cost $12,000 to replace. I declined and will arrange for AAA to tow it home until we can sell the vehicle for scrap per advisor's suggestion as it cannot be traded or sold in this condition.

Water will drain from the windshield into the top of the engine, and begin filling the spark plug wells under the ignition coil boots and into the engine head.  This water intrusion can cause engine misfire codes as well as a loss of power while driving, and on multiple instances while merging into traffic, the engine would bog down.  It wasn't until the most recent occurrence that a check engine light came on.  I immediately pulled into a shop and they found the plug wells were rusted, corroded and full of water from this happening since the day it rolled off the lot in 2019.  I have had an independent mechanic assess the damage as well as had the vehicle towed to a local Ford dealer and they found the same condition- with the only solution to replace the engine head as they are unable to remove the plugs due to the damage caused by the water intrusion.  An owner should not have to be concerned with parking or driving a vehicle in the rain and whether it will suddenly lose power while driving at highway speeds.  This is a safety issue that Ford should be forced to take care of.  They are aware of the issue and have been as they have issued multiple service bulletins with a solution for misfires to change plugs and install an engine cover.  An engine cover has no bearing on an engine misfire but it shows Ford knows water is getting into engines and causing these problems.  Engine/plugs/coils failed, it is available for inspection.  Mine and public safety was at risk when driving as it lost power merging into traffic.   Problem has been confirmed by dealer and independent mechanic.   Last instance (2/9/24) was first time a CEL came on while driving",IVOQ,N,,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,V,,N,N

The vehicle then said all wheel drive not available.  After that electrical components started going unavailable such as power steering, brake assist, blind spot monitoring, cameras, and traction control.  The vehicle then shut down while driving and all I could do was brake.  When I attempted to restart the vehicle it did not restart.  I jumped it and was able to safely pull it off the road.  This is the 2nd time in three weeks this happened. Ford looked at the vehicle and tightened the battery cables.  Then told me it was fine.",IVOQ,N,,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,V,,N,N
