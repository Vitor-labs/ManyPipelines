When engaging FSD ,the display screen enters an AUTO brightness mode and requires driver intervention to adjust brightness back to the driver's desired setting, as described by the following. When FSD is engaged, display AUTO brightness is activated and the screen adjusts up in brightness from the previous setting, which is often too high. The driver's attention is then taken away from road and traffic ahead while the screen is reset to the driver's preferred setting. In the current build the following anomalies also occur. When FSD is engaged and the display is set to AUTO brightness, if the driver opens the Display menu and adjusts brightness down, that driver setting is held even though the Display brightness is still shown to be in AUTO mode. However, if after activating FSD and the AUTO brightness is engaged, and the brightness is then adjusted down using the left scroll wheel, the display remains in AUTO mode and the screen is automatically adjusted back up to the AUTO set point. This is true when the driver's preferred setting is lower than the AUTO set point, but not true if the driver's preferred setting is higher than the AUTO set point. When the initial driver setting is higher than the AUTO set point, the screen remains at the driver's preferred setting. While these anomalies are not safety concerns, per se, they do require that the driver's attention is diverted to resetting the desired display brightness. If, as if often the case, FSD is disengaged and then reengaged, the process described above is repeated. In the course of a 30 minute drive this can require that the driver adjust screen brightness multiple times, sometimes repeating the adjustment process within minutes after prior adjustment.

I was told by Hyundai service department, that perhaps were driving to close to other vehicles to cause this, but it happened several times when there are no vehicles or objects present. Apparently they had no interest in resolving this matter, they claim that the system test showed no duplication of said issue,  vehicle was taken on a road test and they found no issues, The recall were all fixed, and I was called to pick up vehicle. I drove a few and the braking started again, so I pulled over and started recording to see if happens again and I was able to catch some of this problem on video. This has caused my husband to lose control of the vehicle causing him to hit a cone on the road. Your immediate help with this matter would be greatly appreciate.

So I brought it to my local Nissan dealership and they said they would fix the recall. After checking out my key and car the dealership said I would have to buy a brand new key which was around $300 dollars. The key is only 3 months old because I changed out the old key because the recall caused the old key to malfunction and not start up the car. They're solution was to put a spacer in the key to fix the recall but then said my car wouldn't turn on if they put in spacer to fix recall. My problem is why would i have to purchase something that is being recalled, also if it's a factory recall that would mean it has to be fixed as part of a federal law. Also, the reason for both keys malfunctioning is because of the recall in the first place. It seems the dealership is trying to get out of fixing this problem and they just want me to buy a new key to fix the issue instead of taking care of it, when it was the manufacturer's fault in the first place. The Nissan dealership is Destination Nissan located at 770 Central Ave, Albany, NY 12206, is there anything that can be done so they fix this issue? I also reached out to Nissan national help line, but they couldn't do anything but reach out to the dealership and ask what happened with no solution. They ended up not fixing the recall or anything on my vehicle and I currently have both keys that are malfunctioning because of Manufacturer Recall Number: R22C9 and NHTSA Recall Number 23V-093. But now I am at risk of key malfunctioning while driving and turning the car off and could cause possible crash, injury or worse. I don't understand how they can do this because under federal law they would need to fix any problems caused by this recall. Please any help would be greatly appreciated.

On four separate occasions just today (although it happens at least once or twice a day), with the cruise set to 70 MPH, the car will randomly decelerate aggressively or even change the max speed of the cruise to 55 MPH.  On all occasions, the posted speed limit is 65 or even 75 mph.  This is dangerous, particularly in DFW traffic during rush hours, with traffic flow moving at similar and often higher speeds in close proximity.  Having my car aggressively decelerate without warning to 55 MPH has caused me to be tailgated and honked at.    This has been happening since I've received my car.  At first, I tried to use the advanced features of the cruise, but whilst driving on the Dallas Tollways, where the toll road has a speed limit of 75 MPH and the regular highway paralleling at 65, the car is unable to differentiate and would often interpret the wrong speed limit and aggressively brake.  Going from the flow of traffic (close to 80 MPH) to 65.  This is why I switched the cruise to absolute speed rather than any sort of posted adaptive.    It's seems to have gotten progressively worse.  So much so that I only use the cruise where traffic is light because of this issue's unexpected and random nature.  Besides being dangerous, it's also very scary as it's completely unexpected and aggressive.

There were no reasons for any automatic hazard overrides to become active.  Dashboard displays stayed on but there was no accelerator response, and, importantly, there was an immediate loss of power steering and power brakes. Vehicle was traveling uphill and the emergency brakes had to be applied to arrest backward motion after coming to a stop. Judging by rate of slowdown, regenerative braking may also have been active. Rapidly following this, several diagnostic/warning messages (re brakes, steering, etc) started flashing in succession and then the message ""see your dealer."" About 10 minutes after this incident, my wife made one attempt to restart the car after turning the car off and then on.  The response was a repeat of the flashing messages.  I arrived at the scene about 20 minutes after this and the car restarted in a normal fashion. So, unfortunately, this is an intermittent, difficult-to-firmly-diagnose problem. Nevertheless, in view of the severe safety issues associated with this failure, we had the car towed to a Honda dealer.  They found several items in the car's diagnostic system and, in consultation with Honda engineers, performed a software update for the ICM (ignition control module?) which, we were told, would address this problem, since other similar complaints had apparently been registered. The HUGE SAFETY ISSUE that this failure represents (loss of power along with steering assistance and braking assistance plus possibly more rapid deceleration) cannot be overestimated. We will be risking our lives to believe that the software fix truly addresses this problem. To believe that a software update is a sure fix is to believe that Honda knows the exact reason for this failure, and if they do, it is absurd that a software recall has not been issued.

It may take 2 - 3 tries. It has never failed to eventually unlock. I don't know that it ever failed to lock because approaching the car it would have already been unlocked. I don't always hear it actuate.  Auto-lock: I assume the same proximity system that is supposed to detect the keyless fob inside/outside at a distance - could be responsible for failure to auto-lock upon leaving the vehicle. Dependably securing vehicles is a major security problem is some areas and that is a major impetus behind keeping cars locked/and unlocking only as the driver approaches. Imagine being in a desolate parking garage late at night and the door chooses that particular moment to fail to cooperate. Or, if a driver trusts the auto-lock to work and it doesn't.   App: In fairness, Mazda does have the MyMazda app that will eventually report to a phone that the car detects that it is unlocked. It seems unreliable. Currently the app has a ""star rating"" of about 1:10 3 or fewer for various issues. You can't make everyone nor every device cooperate - and to a degree, I can't say that's the problem. I would expect something wrong with the fob or proximity detection system. Just as likely, the door lock actuator has issues.   Summary of Problem: Maybe about as many times, the app informs me the car is unlocked when it should have auto-locked. So is it a keyless, app or door actuator problem? Or, a combination? And, it works MOST of the time. I eventually asked myself if I would want someone's wife or kids out there and door locks fail at a critical moment. I must say, I haven't reported it formally because of the intermittent nature and the fact I have an issue with Mazda that has existed from the beginning. Major body parts are poorly fit and beyond contestation. If Mazda ignores that constant issue, an intermittent problem is likely to be as well.",IVOQ,N,,N,N,N,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,V,,N,N

The service tech said, and I'm quoting, ""The system is very sensitive and a swift kick could cause it to malfunction."" That sounds like a manufacturing defect to me. I have never been in an accident with this car, there is zero visible damage to the front bumper, and my computer has no report of an accident. The dealership urged me to contact insurance. My Major Insurance Company told me this was absurd, would never be approved, and is clearly mechanical.

Then I called Hyundai Corporate and they have escalated the issue, agree it sounds mechanical, and will be contacting me in 3-5 business days. They apologized profusely so I am still holding out hope for warranty coverage. I believe the dealership is trying to blame me for this mechanical failure to avoid expense on their end.

The entire body of the vehicle shook violently.  The only way to recover from the severe oscillation was to reduce speed substantially - generally to below 40 mph - or to encounter another bump to upset the oscillation.  We took the Gladiator to a local Jeep dealership. They stated they replaced the steering damper and that the manufacturer had updated the part number (the failed damper was the old part number).

My Hyundai Ioniq 6 alerted me of a (non-existent) impending front-end collision, and within 1 second of the alert starting, the automatic emergency braking system activated. This resulted in the violent (and unexpected) braking of my car to around 25mph. There was no clear reason for the collision detection alert or the automatic emergency brake. The light was good and there was no significant weather. There were no vehicles immediately in front or behind me.  (Nearest car in front was over a quarter mile away.)  The force of the braking was sufficiently strong that I am still sore in my shoulder and back a week later.  I am fortunate that there wasn't a car close behind me, as I likely would have been rear-ended due to the unexpected and abrupt nature of the braking.  The vehicle was taken in for service (invoice attached) and ""calibrated"".   Within 10 miles of getting back on the highway, warnings (but no braking) triggered again.

IF the loss of all dashboard function had occurred while driving, it would have presented very dangerous safety issues. Situation reviewed with local BMW dealership and BMW corporate customer relations. No recalls or warnings have been issued. Expressed my concerns in detail. This is a potentially dangerous problem for the BMW E90 models. The RDC module is located in the passenger rear wheel well and repeatedly exposed to wet/ snow/ slush conditions.  This is a dangerous location outside the vehicle for the RDC module. The Tire pressure monitor system is a non-critical function.

I've had the same issues with my 2016 for a few years now. I've stalled while driving and the steering wheel locks up when that happens. When starting from a stop, it is worse. I once was taking a left turn and it happened. Luckily I wasn't going across during a busy time, I might have been hit. I've gotten my car looked at several times and no one could tell me what was wrong. I even put in a new fuel pump because all of the systems seemed to be related to the fuel pump. And that didn't change anything either. It has to be the modular but whatever it is, this is serious and I cannot believe the 2016 has not been included in the recall. I have to mash the gas a lot, it seems to kind of help in preventing stalling sometimes. But if you have someone right in front of you, and you're making a turn, thats very difficult to mash the gas to prevent a stall while turning. I know I am mentioning turning a lot, it doesn't matter if I am turning or going straight, but I feel like it's more dangerous when it happens while turning as the steering wheel locks up when the car stalls. Throwing it in neutral doesn't even unlock the steering wheel. You can't quickly fix the issue, you have to switch the ignition off and restart it to unlock the steering wheel, that's not something that can be done quick enough to avoid an accident that is about to happen right before your eyes. Please look into this. I feel like it is immoral of Honda to not include other Fit models in the recall. They must know it's not only the 2018-2019 models. There is no way that my car is the only 2016 this is happening to. I greatly appreciate any effort you are willing to put into investigating this matter.",IVOQ,N,,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,V,,N,N

[XXX] ) When I was driving my car down Highway [XXX] I lost braking control completely, with a series of constant beeping starting to emit from the braking system. Luckily through mashing the brake pedal and using ebrake I was able to get the car to slow down and pull off the highway. The brakes sporadically and randomly cut in and out with the power braking, leading to uncontrolled stopping power and jerky or inactive braking. There had been lights on the dash indicating the traction system or braking system had issues but these would frequently turn off and on and didn't result in a loss of braking ability or performance and had been there a couple months. Upon taking the vehicle to a Toyota Dealership (Charles Maund North Austin) I was told it was a C1391 error regarding a failure of the brake booster pump assembly and that it would need to be replaced and reprogrammed for about 3300 dollars. After looking online I saw there were many other people with this issue, all who were unable to fix this in the given 10 year frame. Many unsuspecting second owners of this vehicle do not know that there is a hidden danger waiting for them when their power brake pump assembly fails. If I had been a less experienced driver I would've certainly crashed and Toyota, knowing of this safety concern already, should have done the right thing and issue a recall for these vehicles.

Made appointment with Ford dealership to have it looked at the next morning.  After car was parked and restarted, wrench light went off.  Kept appointment and told them a mechanic friend said it sounded like the torque converter (which my mother who has a 2019 Ford Edge just had replaced the week before!).  Explained this to the dealership, they said it didn't sound like that was it.  4 wheel drive module was corrupt so they updated it and told me I may need a new transmission in the near future.  Today, my light came on again while taking my son to school and caused lack of acceleration while pulling onto the highway and I took it to the dealership while it was lit up.

The truck ahead was moving from the right lane to the left to give room to a car stopped on the right shoulder. There was another car in the left lane so I couldn’t move to the left. The truck was soon blocking much of the left lane so the car in the left lane was slowing as I slowed. I then applied my brakes and the pedal went all the way to the floor without actuating the brakes! Fortunately, by then there was room between the truck and the car on the shoulder and I was able to miss both as I sailed by.  Pumping the brake pedal restored the brake function. Thinking that I must be low on brake fluid, I pulled off the highway at the next large service station. The brake fluid reservoir was full. I continued to my new home and at my first opportunity I went to the nearest VW dealership and left it for several days to be checked. No error codes so they did nothing. VW customer service arranged for another dealership to check it out. No error codes and not able to reproduce the problem so they did nothing. About a month later I was one a trip on a very hilly rout. Costing down a steep section I applied the brakes as I started to be more than 10 mph over the speed limit. The pedal went about 80% to the floor! But there was braking this time. Pumping the pedal restored normal brake function.

All dash lights came on, black smoke out exhaust. Only issue I had prior to this breakdown was excess oil use. $150 tow to Bengston Tire & Service in Salina, KS. They diagnosed cylinder misfires, spark-plug disintegration & recommended to take it to a Kia Dealership to be looked at, as they said it likely required an entire engine replacement. After a $440 tow, it was looked at by the Kia Dealership of Manhattan, KS, who ultimately did state that my vehicle would require a $7k engine replacement. The said I did not qualify for the 10 year/100k warranty since I was a 2nd owner.   Since I still owed on my loan, I decided it was not worth putting the time/funds to fix. I had it towed home for $800. After searching online for hours with my VIN to search recalls, my Sorento did not show up in any recalls, class action suites, etc.  During all of this I had to rent a car, which in total from [XXX], when I purchased a new vehicle, I spent $1,530 in total rental fees.   It wasn't until I was researching that I found out about the KSDS sensor that many other Kia owners were having installed to assist in the prevention of a situation that my Kia had put me in 12/2023. Kia had never sent me any information on this and the Kia dealership never told me about this, nor offered to help in ANY way with another vehicle that likely should be added to the engine failure recall, as all my symptoms fit the bill.   Oakes Kia of Kansas City, MO also told me previously that the excess engine oil consumption was normal, and just part of having a GDI Engine.   I sold my Kia for $5k to a buyer who could fix it up. The KBB value of my Sorento was $14,000, as besides the engine failure the rest of the vehicle was in amazing condition with no other issues. I have lost a significant amount of money with this loss that I believe could've been easily prevented or at least better prevented by the manufacturer.

Additionally, a battery replacement was deemed necessary. Coincidentally, on the same day, a recall notice was issued regarding the starter, citing a fire risk associated with the component.  In light of the recall notice, the vehicle was relocated from the auto shop to my residence. On [XXX], the car was then towed to the dealership for further investigation and confirmation of the starter diagnostic, as advised by Hyundai corporate by an agent named, Doreen.  I contacted Hyundai corporate on Friday, [XXX] , seeking guidance about the starter diagnosis. Their recommendation was to have the car towed to the dealership to validate the starter issue. She stated they will be able to expedite the resolution process at a national level once the dealership confirms the diagnosis.   Today, on [XXX], Capitol Hyundai in San Jose, CA, associate by the name of Ali Lee, informed me that the starter was not the culprit; rather, it was identified as a ""faulty"" new battery installed six months ago.

I have approximately 12,500 miles on this Jeep and have NOT had one alert with this amount of mileage, I have has a couple close calls where I have had to take evasive action and heavy braking to avoid a collision and not even had a warning of any kind. There are to many people complaining of this same issue and many of the same people are quoting the same company verbiage and quotes from the jeep service departments saying that the system is functioning correctly, and there is no way to test the system. Please look into this issue and research just how many people are complaining of this issue, if your going to advertise and promote a safety system on vehicles you should have an expectation that the system actually works. Any safety system that is not functioning properly puts people in danger when the said system would prevent or minimize damage in a collision situation.

During our phone conversation, he stated that this is a known issue with KIA vehicles excessively burning oil, which then causes the catalytic converter to clog and the engine to die. It is a fatal flaw and there is no fix other than to replace the engine, which I would have to pay for. He said KIA extended certain warranties, but mine was not one of them.

We took it to a mechanic and then transferred to a dealer and both confirmed it was the water pump. Ford negligently designed the water pump within the engine with the timing chain.

Like it will try to crank up but can't. I have had this car for less than a year. After the dealership ""fixed"" the fuel injector this issue started. When it finally starts the car smells strongly of gas. Third: there was a recall on a hose that had to do with the A/c system. It leaked onto wires and caused a shortage in my whole electrical system which in turn caused the vehicle to shut down on me while I was driving on the interstate.   Fourth: The blind spot warning goes crazy when you are driving down a road with no one beside you. Fifth: The lane keeping assistant has completely stopped working. I have reset the system and it still will not work. Sixth: the radio, bluetooth, sound system does not work because of the water that leaked onto the wires from the A/C pipe that was recalled.  Now my biggest issue is that the dealership that I purchased the vehicle from tried to charge me to have the recalls fixed. I had to take it to another dealership and afterwards was informed that, that specific dealership will claim to replace the recalls but not actually do the work so that way you have to come back and they can charge you for the work.

We are fortunate that an accident did not occur during any of these times however the last incident came very close. Very frightening !!

I am writing to bring to your attention a critical safety issue I recently encountered with my 2015 Ford Escape. I am deeply concerned about the lack of response and accountability from Ford regarding this matter, and I kindly request your assistance in addressing this potentially life-threatening problem. During a recent incident, my vehicle's power steering suddenly failed, rendering the car extremely difficult to maneuver. The lack of power steering made it nearly impossible for me to maintain a straight line, let alone perform any evasive maneuvers to avoid potential hazards on the road. Fortunately, this incident occurred in a drive-thru, and my children were not present in the vehicle at the time. I dread to think of the consequences if this failure had happened while driving at higher speeds or in a more critical situation. Upon taking my car to the Ford dealership for inspection and repair, I was shocked to learn that the power steering issue is not covered under my warranty. The dealership informed me that because my vehicle has exceeded 60,000 miles and is now over four years old, it falls outside the warranty coverage. I find it deeply troubling that Ford refuses to acknowledge the obvious flaw in the design of the car's power steering system, especially when comparable Ford models such as the 2011-2013 Fusion have been recalled for the exact same issue. As a loyal Ford customer, I implore you to thoroughly investigate and address this widespread problem, not only for my own sake but also for the safety and well-being of countless other Ford owners who may be facing similar risks. This dangerous design flaw poses a significant threat to drivers and their passengers, and it is utterly irresponsible for Ford to shirk responsibility and shift the financial burden onto the customers.

He gets other German Cars like BMW & Audi even older and more miles in Chicago but none have rusted so much as these MB C-Class cars. Knowing the Dealers wont accept it a manufacturing defect, he was planning to repair it (no chance of wielding that thin metal sheet as the likelihood of breaking it is high).

The vehicle was driven on paved roads, within city at a max speed of 60 miles per hour.

This is a serious quality concern and I am afraid to drive Subaru with Subaru parts in it. ALl while it is advertised as rugged off road vehicle.  After reading through forums, it was found that a lot of folks have had this issue and SUbaru has had recalls on some vehicles for the same quality of windshield issue.   The response from Subaru was that they make thin glass because of eyesight technology. Either ways, Subaru has compromised on quality to add a piece of technology.

They provided me with a rental and told me I needed a catalytic converter that was clogged due to heavy oil consumption and my oil was low, even thought it was 3000 miles from the next scheduled change. I paid for the services and picked my car up approximately 6 days later. In December my cars engine light came on and I started having acceleration issues again. I took it to my local dealership and was told by the service advisor that it was covered under the recall to 150,000 miles for knocking and seizing and to continue driving it. They changed the oil and I went on my way. [XXX]  my engine light came on again and I called and scheduled an appointment. I dropped it off on [XXX] After 2 1/2 weeks of calling daily with no return phone calls and paying out of pocket for a rental the dealership called and said it was the camshaft. I work part time for a auto wholesales parts company and the director, who has 40 years automotive experience told me the camshaft would have nothing to do with the oil consumption. After researching on internet and finding numerous videos stating the same, I told them change the oil and I would pick it up. The next day I went to pick it up and the battery was dead. The battery was just replaced in November. They jumped it twice, I expressed my uneasiness leaving with it but was told service is closed and the have no loaners. On the way out of the parking lot, a man that stated he was the sales manager was waving and yelling “bye, don’t come back, get out of my lot”. Needless to say I was appalled.

Originally when we realized that our engine was burning oil we were told that we need to get an oil change, which we did.

They told us they are cleaning the engine. 500 miles later, on Sunday [XXX] our spark plugs blew. We got our car towed to the dealer, Spitzer Hyundai of Cleveland. Spitzer Hyundai is procrastinating and making stories. Each time we do what they ask, they want additional tests done to confirm the engine is burning oil. One of the employees told us at the beginning: we know and you know the engine is burning oil, but Hyundai needs to confirm that. Now the dealership is asking us to drive another 1000 miles again. The problem is that the spark plugs are shot and need to be replaced. They only need to be replaced because of the faulty engine. They want us to pay $700 to replace the spark plugs when it might fail again in another 100 miles. Meanwhile we have car rental expenses plus other expenses and a headache dealing with the company Hyundai and the dealership Spitzer Hyundai. every time I drove those 1000 miles i was always worried that the engine would stop working if the oil would burn out. My local mechanic is the one who diagnosed my engine to burn oil, and he said not to replace the spark plugs, because it will fail once again.  Even if they approve the engine replacement they will probably want to charge us $700 for the cost to ""take apart the engine and send pictures to Hyundai"".

I called my local Honda dealership to schedule the repair. I was scheduled and the day of my appointment they called to cancel stating the parts were not in. I waited till January 2024 and called back and they stated that they are still working out a plan with Honda and at this time no parts are available but they should be coming in the next month or two. I just got a letter in the mail today stating that it is going to be fall 2024 before parts are available. After reading this safety, recall letter I received from Honda it stating why the vehicles under recall, and the safety consequence regarding it. My check engine light is not on however, my vehicle has been acting like it is going to stall out several times while I’m driving under 35 mph. I’m very concerned because this is the only vehicle I have and I have four children and the thought of possibly being in an accident is very scary to think about, due to Honda not having a replacement part to fix the recall. This is assuming that the parts would be in by fall to fix the vehicle.  I don’t have another vehicle to access so if I happen to get into accident and it’s due to my vehicle stalling would Honda then be liable for the wreck?  I am little frustrated and have never in my life experienced an issue with Honda until now. If the parts are “unavailable” then I personally feel Honda should be paying for rental vehicles for these families who don’t have any other choices. I would rather pay for a rental than be sued for “potential injury” where the recall paper states that having an inoperable fuel pump, could prevent an engine from starting, causing the vehicle to lose power or stalling, while driving increasing the risk of an injury or crash.

I was driving the speed limit of 55 mph.   The car hit a pot-hole and the right front tire shattered, meaning that the rim of the tire snapped into two pieces along the circumference of the rim.   I am drawing your attention to this occurrence because a rim of the wheel shouldn't snap into two pieces after hitting a nominal pot-hole driving at normal speeds.  The tire, the rim both had to be replaced and work was needed to test the car for further damage and to re-align the tires amounting to an expense of ~ $1,826.   I believe the material strength of the metal of the rim of the wheel, is not specked correctly for normal road conditions.  After hitting the pot hole, the car was extremely hard to control in order to drive to the side of the fast moving interstate highway.   It was only by luck and my experience in driving that I was able to pull over in ~ 5 lanes of high speed traffic.   The car is very heavy due to the battery in the car.  It was essentially like driving a slab of cement with no directional capability.  This is very dangerous and I am drawing this to your attention to prevent auto accidents that can cause human death.

The current recall for the battery requires software that reduces the battery by 80% which interferes with my driving schedule. This is a huge safety risk parking a vehicle that could potentially light on fire. I talked with GM and they can't guarantee that the software will detect if the battery has an issue.  ,IVOQ,N,,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,V,,N,N

I just all of the sudden lose power. On one occasion in particular, [XXX], I was driving on the highway with my 5 year old in the back seat. I suddenly and totally lost all accelerator/gas pedal power while in the passing lane. I rapidly lost speed and was decelerating with a truck directly behind me and another vehicle to my right in the regular lane. I had to quickly turn on my emergency flashers and pray the truck behind me was paying attention and didn’t hit me. I was jamming up traffic until I was able to get pulled over off the road. My vehicle has been into Hyundai’s garage a total of four times now for the same issue. They have yet to find the root of the problem or fix it. I recently picked up my car on [XXX] from the garage and exactly two weeks later it did it again, this time with my husband in the car so it is once again back in the garage. The last trip to the garage they were able to duplicate the issue but can’t find a cause. Twice my check engine light came on after the fact but only two of the four times.

There have been numerous software issues since I purchased the vehicle. Yesterday while driving at low speed, a car in front of me at a stop light slammed on brakes. I attempted to depress the brake but it was too late. My car collided with the vehicle in front. I did not initially see the driver ahead of me stop as I was looking to the side for oncoming traffic. All of the ADAS systems are activated in my vehicle and set to the most sensitive settings including the autonomous emergency braking/FCW which is set to “Early” response. My vehicle provided no warning of the impending collision nor did it attempt to brake on its own. There is an issue with the AEB functionality in the i7 that needs to be investigated.   In addition to this issue, there’s also a problem with the automatic brake hold function when the car stops. Due to poor programming, after bringing the car to a stop by using regenerative braking the car then rolls backward or forward (depending on the slope) before the auto hold function applies the brakes.  This is unlike any other car with this function including other BMWs we have owned. It increases the likelihood of a collision as the car rolls after coming to a complete stop. I have driven another electric BMW and experienced this issue. It is also mentioned all over various BMW owner forums.   My vehicle cost $137,000 and did not even alert of a forward collision or attempt to brake on its own as it is supposed to. Furthermore the car is also supposed to detect and record video of any accidents that occur but the car did not detect it was in an accident. BMW/NHTSA needs to investigate the i7 and other EVs BMW produces. There is no logical reason the car did not alert about an impending collision or attempt to brake on its own. I also learned my vehicle is subject to a recall related to the integrated brake booster. I’m unsure if this could have played a roll in the car not stopping.
