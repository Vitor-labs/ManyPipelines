Y car back everything was fine until I suddenly get this sudden jerking of my car after I had made a right hand turn and as I was trying to accelerate to the posted speed limit, I honestly believed that one of my tires was about to break off while driving on the freeway with my two daughters in the vehicle with me while traveling to my sister's house nearly 35 minutes away from my residence. When I felt it, it startled me to the point where I believed that I might have popped a tire. I pulled over to check and nothing visible was wrong. Being 5 minutes away from my sisters house I drove to her house with my hazard lights on and after every turn I would feel as if one of my tires was going to just fall right off. My brother in law is a mechanic and I asked him to take it for a careful drive in an empty parking lot so he can feel what I was trying to explain to him. So he did and he said that it might be either the transmission not shifting properly and could be slipping, or the second theory is that the rear toe link can be either broken or damaged. He didn't know that I had already taken it to the dealer to have it replaced. I told him that the dealer had already replaced the rear toe link and his facial expression was very clear to understand that he was not sure if they did actually fix it or possibly mess with something else,  because they might have believed I would have taken my car to get fixed there.

The issue at hand revolves around a defective water pump, which has manifested in various models, including but not limited to:  - Ford Edge - Ford Explorer - Ford Flex - Ford Fusion - Ford Taurus - Lincoln Continental - Lincoln MKT - Lincoln MKX  Owners of these vehicles are experiencing a significant and alarming risk of stalling in traffic, posing a severe threat to both driver and passenger safety. The potential consequences, including the increased likelihood of accidents and fatalities, demand immediate attention and action from Ford Motor Company who has been sued multiple times and is avoiding to respond to the judgements against them trying to use any excuse not to pay.  It is imperative to address this widespread concern promptly, as the safety and well-being of Ford and Lincoln vehicle owners are at stake. I urge your organization to conduct a thorough investigation into the defective water pump issue, implement a comprehensive recall, and provide a reliable solution to rectify the problem.  Your commitment to prioritizing the safety of consumers is paramount, and I trust that Ford Motor Company will take swift and decisive action to remedy this situation. By addressing this issue promptly, you not only ensure the protection of current owners but also uphold the reputation of Ford and Lincoln in the automotive industry.

If a microscopic crack is present, condensation can potentially enter the reversing lamp lens through these cracks and cause electrical failure to the reverse lamps. Safety Risk This may result in inoperative reverse lamps which can reduce the awareness of other motorists or road users of the drivers intention to operate the vehicle in reverse gear, increasing the risk of injury or crash. Remedy Ford Motor Company has authorized your dealer to replace the rear lightbar free of charge parts and labor.  Campaign/NHTSA# 23C38/23V801 Issue Date 2023-11-28 Description Affected vehicles may have software logic that does not reset the electronic stability control esc system to default operation at the initiation of each ignition cycle. Section 5.4.1 of fmvss no. 126 requires that the vehicles esc system return to the manufacturers original default esc mode at the initiation of each ignition cycle Safety Risk The vehicle operator may not notice that the vehicle operates differently after receiving the ota update 6.3.0 and now remains in off-road mode with a reduced esc state after cycling the ignition. If the vehicle operator does not notice the esc off telltale in the cluster, they may not know the vehicle is in a reduced esc state. For these vehicles, failing to revert back to a normal esc-on state after being in off-road mode makes the vehicles noncompliant to fmvss no. 126, increasing the risk of crash. Remedy The remedy for this program is a software update to accessory protocol interface module apim.

In the recent weeks of 1/5/2024 - 2/9/2024 the Power steering assist has gone out while maneuvering in and out of our garage multiple times. With a restart, the power assist comes back and seems to be ok for a few days until recently while driving, multiple times the steering wheel became locked in the 12:00 position and it took extra effort to turn the wheel from center. It appears as a faulty or sized rack and pinion. Also recently noticed audible noise while turning the steering wheel from lock to lock coming from the steering rack.  I am an Automotive Technician in the field for 30+ years. That next morning I raised the vehicles front wheels off the ground and rotated the steering wheel with engine off to investigate the issue. I noticed a severe binding issue while rotating the steering wheel where the steering wheel will come to a binding stop and it takes 2 hands to get past the binding. At this point I knew this is a major safety concern and to not have my wife drive this vehicle anymore until repaired. I have researched the Technical Service bulletins on this issue and searched the internet as well. Obviously this has become a very common issue on these Explorers with all the filed complaints and the lack of availability of a replacement Rack and Pinion. I went to the Ford dealer to inquire about this known issue and safety concern and they said there are no recalls for this problem on this vehicle.  Fortunately I caught this issue before the rack and pinion did seize into a position where my wife would not have been able to steer out of it and crash into another person, car or object. I understand that components eventually wear and fail over the vehicles lifetime and need replacing, but this seems to be a bigger issue and safety concern which needs addressing.

Vehicle taken to dealer where purchased (Scott Peterson Ford-Sturgis, SD). They found the code indicated #1 cylinder misfire, running and upon start up. They cleared codes and could not duplicate the misfire. Said they could not figure out the issue and sent us back on the road. The vehicle was still under factory warranty. We continued to use the vehicle with check engine light coming on and going off occasionally. The check engine light appeared in Sept 2023. We had the spark plugs changed and the coolant system flushed at our service station. The check engine light went off. It would come on again, go off, sporadically. Then in January 2024 the check engine light came on and the heater wouldn't work. We checked the coolant level and it was almost completely out. We filled coolant back up, the check engine light went off, and all seemed good. Within 2 weeks the check engine light came on again and the coolant was completely out. No leaks noticed anywhere. I researched and found lots of articles/lawsuit against Ford for this very issue. It included potential fire issue from engine overheating and more. We returned the vehicle to the dealership (now Wareing Ford Sturgis) and they indicated it was probably a leak into the engine itself, which was a known problem by Ford and the dealerships. They mentioned some customers were buying extended warranty coverage before having the dealership diagnose the problem and that it could save us a lot of money. I said that was dishonest and not something I would do. They then diagnosed the issue and they were correct, coolant was leaking into the engine and had caused engine failure. The repair estimate is $13,000. I have complaint filed w/ Ford, which is saying the car is out of warranty. They said to keep our receipts in case Ford ends up having to pay.

According to Ford recall 23S27 and NHTSA recall 23V380, this is a known issue and could have put our family at significant risk.  We spoke to many people at Ford but they denied warranty coverage due to ""improper oil filter installation"". We were without our vehicle for 2 months before we decided to have another mechanic give an estimate and complete the repairs. The repair was a full engine replacement costing $7,000+.  Ford has since refused to reimburse us for the repair costs.  The incident occurred on 10/6/23 with around 52,000 miles.

My car smells like burnt oil and then I got this recall notice.  I called Yark and Brondes dealerships and both refuse to do a diagnostic on my car unless I pay them for a 1/2 day's wages or $160 or more.  They both acknowledged knowing about the recall.  I am a senior citizen on a fixed income and am really upset they won't do a free diagnostic to confirm I do not have a fractured engine oil pump drive belt tensioner arm.  My Powertrain is still under warranty, and they still will not do the diagnostic free unless I have a problem.  If I do have a problem, they don't have the part to fix it.  In the meantime, I risk burning up my engine or having it catch on fire.  I park my car in an attached garage so a potential car fire while in my garage is a risk to my safety.  The car could literally burn down my house.  I am told Ford won't issue parts until 2nd quarter of 2024.  In the meantime, the dealerships and Ford will not help their customers and just leave them stranded.  I had a Ford Milan, and they did this stall tactic on the Takata airbags.  I never did get that recall completed and I tried to get the dealers to replace it multiple times.  I finally was forced to turn the car in for a new lease. I was too scared to drive it.  I hope you can help me.  I am more than willing to let you inspect my car anytime.  The engine warning light has not yet come on but when I turn off the car it does smell like burnt oil.  I have kept up on all oil changes.  I don't see oil leaking onto garage floor.  Bottom line my safety is being put at risk while Ford plays the waiting game for profit.  I am a senior and disabled.

Appointment was made for next available which was February 12, 2024.  4. February 12, 2012 I take vehicle to Mullinax Ford for 7:30am appointment. Advisor writes up HVBJB issues along with tire rotation and another software update for stuck charging plug.  5. Throughout the 6 hours of waiting at the dealer the service advisor neither updates me or informs me that the HVBJB recall is not taking place. They apparently performed another recall for a parking break release cable that was neither listed on the ford site or NHTSA as a recall applicable to my vehicle.  6. At the end of the 6hours they hand back my vehicle without the HVBJB recall performed and could not tell me when it could be performed or if parts were available or if they had even checked for the parts. They simply said they would get back in touch. I left to mull things over and clear my head.  7. Called back Mullinax Ford from the car and talked to someone named Michael after asking for the service manager. Explained I specially made the appointment a month ago for the HVBJB recall and that didn't happen and I wanted to know when they could have the part on hand and when I could schedule the recall. He said he would research it and call me back. 8. As of [XXX], three days later, I have not received an update.  9.

So needless to say, they were not able to fulfill the works service I pad for that included the oil change, fluid check and tire rotation.  So in the event I get a flat tire, or when I decide to get new tires, I'm going to have to a Ford dealer and pay a premium for tires (I just had the front tires done 2 weeks agao and got Goodyear ties for $161 each, whereas Ford quoted me almost $260 per for the same tire).  And they said they'd also have the charge me to drill, use a cutting torch and something else to  get the lug nut off without damaging the wheel stud;  they didn't give me a cost estimate on that, but going to assume it's between $50-100.  So instead of paying $320 for 2 reach tires like i did 2 weeks, I'd be looking at between $570 - $620 for 2 rear tires because Ford decided to use some cheap lug not that they know are defective, but continue to use them??  I thought the nhtsa was supposed to help consumers and not allow companies to continue taking advantage of consumers.  However, I also submitted something to you about 6-9 months ago on this same vehicle.  Ford has a 2.0 Ecoboost Engine in many vehicles and thousands if not hundreds of thousands have had to replace engines because of Ford's design that causes the cylinder tor something to crack and then coolant leaks into the motor.  The only option once this occurs is to sale to another unexpected buyer, or do want my wife and I had to do and pay Ford another $8500 to put a new motor in, which will probably fail again.

My engine cannot be repaired it has to be replaced! There was no cracked manifold, no blown motor, just this leakage that is the result of a serious design flaw, so serious that Ford quit manufacturing the engine and replaced it with a Series 2 version (it is an ecoboost engine) and my new engine will be the Series 2.  I can't even buy the original engine as it has been pulled from the market.  But my car was sold new to me in August, 2018 with this flawed engine.  I am including pictures the mechanic has taken of the coolant in the engine.  The mechanic would not allow me to pick up my car and drive it after discovering this issue as he said it was a safety issue and could lead to my or other driver's injury or fatality.

There they ran their diagnostic test ($225) and it was found to have the faulty oil pump.  Because this ""recall""  I am told is only a ""notice"" - the cost to fix the car is quoted at ($9000) as it needs a whole new engine now.

Fourth: The blind spot warning goes crazy when you are driving down a road with no one beside you. Fifth: The lane keeping assistant has completely stopped working.

I am writing to bring to your attention a critical safety issue I recently encountered with my 2015 Ford Escape. I am deeply concerned about the lack of response and accountability from Ford regarding this matter, and I kindly request your assistance in addressing this potentially life-threatening problem. During a recent incident, my vehicle's power steering suddenly failed, rendering the car extremely difficult to maneuver. The lack of power steering made it nearly impossible for me to maintain a straight line, let alone perform any evasive maneuvers to avoid potential hazards on the road. Fortunately, this incident occurred in a drive-thru, and my children were not present in the vehicle at the time. I dread to think of the consequences if this failure had happened while driving at higher speeds or in a more critical situation. Upon taking my car to the Ford dealership for inspection and repair, I was shocked to learn that the power steering issue is not covered under my warranty. The dealership informed me that because my vehicle has exceeded 60,000 miles and is now over four years old, it falls outside the warranty coverage. I find it deeply troubling that Ford refuses to acknowledge the obvious flaw in the design of the car's power steering system, especially when comparable Ford models such as the 2011-2013 Fusion have been recalled for the exact same issue. As a loyal Ford customer, I implore you to thoroughly investigate and address this widespread problem, not only for my own sake but also for the safety and well-being of countless other Ford owners who may be facing similar risks. This dangerous design flaw poses a significant threat to drivers and their passengers, and it is utterly irresponsible for Ford to shirk responsibility and shift the financial burden onto the customers.

Fast forward to November 2022, had the vehicle towed to the same dealership for the same issue. Lights on the dash were present, and concern verified that the power steering was completely inoperative. No communication with the unit told me that the power steering control needed to be replaced.

I had no warning lamps, messages, or any symptoms that the vehicle would fail prior to the incident. I got my vehicle towed to the dealership of purchase. They reported that it was an internal failure of the engine from a broken water pump. This is an ongoing issue that Ford is aware of. How does a water pump fail with no indication?

This cover (Ford # BB5Z-9910494-A) is designed with quarter tern thumb screws to hold it on to the undercarriage. While driving on highway, this part fell off and was not recovered. Now my vehicle is at risk of serious damage to either transmission or engine, or both in not having this key part.  The weak design for fastening this metal part to the vehicle is a serious safety hazard, and Ford should provide a resigned replacement part through recall.",IVOQ,N,,N,N,N,,,,,,55.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,V,,N,N

We stopped after a while for gas and then the heat went on. This went on every time we used the car. So we got an appt at local Ford place last week, where we bought car. Took them several days but turns out the coolant is leaking into the engine and we need a new motor to the tune of 7000 bucks. The car never warned us of any malfunctions. It only has 58,000 miles on it but because it is a 2017 it is out of warrantee. I later learned that the EcoBoost cars have a lot of problems with leaking coolant into the motor. Especially the Ford Fusion and we have a 2 L EcoBoost car. ",IVOQ,N,,N,N,N,,,,,,55.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,V,,N,N
